Caterpillar Made Easy

Interactive suite to do the following tasks for the Caterpillar Project being carried out at MIT/Harvard (roughly in sequential order of typical objective):

* ![generate candidate list] (http://bgriffen.scripts.mit.edu/www/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/candidateselection.png) based on tunable isolation and merger history criteria
* inspect lagrangian region properties (size, volume, morphology)
* contruct initial conditions for cosmological simulations using MUSIC (Hahn & Abel 2010).
* run cosmological simulations using P-Gadget3.
* examine contamination of low-resolution particles in resimulation across suite
* create heatmaps of contamination in every projection
* do 3D visualisations of halo and particle velocity field and positions
* submit job via both PBS and SLURM submission systems.

Utlises a number of suites which come with EPD distribution which is a requirement. A number of read modules are not included for Gadget files and the Rockstar halo catalogues. Please contact brendan.f.griffen@gmail.com if you would like to use this software for your simulation suites.
